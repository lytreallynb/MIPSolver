# MIPSolver 最小运行时依赖
# Minimal runtime dependencies for production use

# Core Python packages (already included in standard library)
# tkinter - GUI framework (built-in on most platforms)

# Note: MIPSolver core library has no external runtime dependencies
# The C++ solver backend is compiled and bundled as a Python extension

# For Linux users who need tkinter:
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install tkinter
# Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S tk

# Optional: For better error reporting
# traceback - built-in module
